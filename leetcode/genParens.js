/**
 * This is yet another problem in which I had the right idea, but didn't quite
 * make it all the way there. I tried to just do it with n, when what I needed
 * was to track left AND right parenthesis. I keep restricting myself assuming
 * that the best solution is the most concise one. Allow yourself to have the
 * tools you need to succeed. Limiting yourself isn't helping.
 *
 * i.e. Don't make things harder because you think it's more noble. Make it work
 * then improve is needed.
